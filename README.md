# DDOS-attack
Performing a DDOS attack onto any server that is not yours or you don’t have permission to attack is highly illegal. I do not recommend the attack on any servers other than your own and I am not responsible for what you are going to do with this script. This post is purely educational and shall help you to understand networking and programming with Python. So don’t do stupid things!

# USAGE
Remember to change the IP addresses and port number<br>
Run 'python3 DDOS_attack.py'
